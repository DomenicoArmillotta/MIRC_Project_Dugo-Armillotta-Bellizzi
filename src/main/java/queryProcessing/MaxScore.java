    First, we need the inverted index

    For each query term, you will need to retrieve the posting list for that term from the inverted index.
    In our case we have a query for each term in the lexicon; each query is the single term

    For each document in the posting list, you will need to compute the score of the document for the query.
    This can be done using a scoring function such as BM25 or tf-idf. --> we use bm25

    For each query, you will need to compute the maximum score among all the documents in the posting list for that query.
    This will be the maxscore for the query.

    Once you have computed the maxscores for all the queries, you can store them in a data structure such as an array or a
    dictionary for later use.
